I am currently a PhD student at Fudan University, under the supervision of Prof. Peng Wang. I completed my undergraduate studies at Tianjin University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. My research interests focus on AIOps and the processing of log data, aiming to optimize system performance and enhance operational efficiency through intelligent automation.
